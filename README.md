# Well locations

This is demo project that queries a database of abandoned wells and makes a nice plot of their locations based on some inputs from the user.  It's arranged as a Streamlit app that is ready to be deployed

This version is more stable- now it doesn't crash when you ask for conditions that have no wells!
